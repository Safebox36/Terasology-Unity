# Terasology-Unity

## What is Terasology?

Welcome!

The Terasology project was born from a Minecraft-inspired tech demo and is becoming a stable platform for various types of gameplay settings in a voxel world.

The [creators and maintainers](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology/blob/develop/docs/Credits.md), also known as MovingBlocks, are a diverse mix of software developers, designers, game testers, graphic artists, and musicians and they encourage others to join!

## Playing

Terasology requires Java 8 - [download it here](https://www.java.com/en/download/). Also make sure that your graphics card driver is up to date.

For easy setup (recommended) you can use their launcher - [download it here](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/TerasologyLauncher/releases)

Direct download stable builds are uploaded to [their release section here on GitHub](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology/releases) while the cutting-edge develop version can be downloaded direct [here from their Jenkins](http://jenkins.terasology.org/job/DistroOmega/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/distros/omega/build/distributions/TerasologyOmega.zip)

For more information about playing like hot keys or server hosting see the [dedicated page](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology/blob/master/docs/Playing.md) or check out the [modules](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology/blob/master/docs/Modules.md)


## Developing (Java Version)

MovingBlocks have gone to great lengths to make developing and modding Terasology as easy as possible, using Gradle to automate just about everything. As long as you have a [Java 8 SDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) running from source is a two step process:

* Clone the code or download a zip
* Run `gradlew game` (on Unixes, including macOS, run `./gradlew` everywhere you see `gradlew`) in the root of the project directory 

That's really it! If you want the project set up in IntelliJ (our favored IDE) you run `gradlew idea` then load the generated project config. Then you get a bunch of run configurations and other stuff for free!

For more on developing/modding see the [wiki](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology/wiki)
